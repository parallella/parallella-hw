# Wideband SDR Transceiver for Parallella

This repository contains the design and manufacturing files for an RF daughter card that adds 300MHz-3.8GHz broadband SDR transmit/receive capability to the [Parallella board](http://www.parallella.org).

Please note that the design has not been manufactured and fully tested as yet. However, it is derived from the tried-and-tested Myriad-RF 1 module and only relatively minor changes to this design were required.

Interest in a manufacturing run of the daughter card is being gauged via an [online poll](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L6TBZ55).
